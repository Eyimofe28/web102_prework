# WEB102 Prework - *Sea Monster Crowdfunding*

Submitted by: **Eyimofe Ajagunnaâœ¨**

**Sea Monster** is a website for the company Sea Monster Crowdfunding that displays information about the games they have funded.

Time spent: Approximately **15** hours spent in total

## Required Features

I successfully completed the following **required** functionalitiesðŸš€:

* [ ] The introduction section explains the background of the company and how many games remain unfunded.
* [ ] The Stats section includes information about the total contributions and dollars raised as well as the top two most funded games.
* [ ] The Our Games section initially displays all games funded by Sea Monster Crowdfunding
* [ ] The Our Games section has three buttons that allow the user to display only unfunded games, only funded games, or all games.

## Additional Features

I added the following tweaks to the page cause I love to go above and beyondðŸ˜‰:

* [ ] Created a dropdown menu with a "scroll to" button to enable smooth scrolling to different sections of the page (Intro, Stats, & Games). ðŸ˜Ž
* [ ] Implemented a fixed header to keep the navigation easily accessible during scrolling. ðŸ«¡
* [ ] Developed a search bar that allows users to filter the displayed games in real-time as they type, and show an error message when no games match the search queries. ðŸ¤“
* [ ] Adjusted several default designs of the webpage to make it more visually appealing. ðŸ˜ƒ

## Notes
I encountered a few challenges while working on this projectðŸ¤§...
* [ ] Trying to use a CSS function for two different functionalities { the mistakes I made along the way turned out to be even better than my vision so yay :) }
* [ ] Making the webpage responsive across different devices { was unable to make it responsive on smaller devices but I ain't giving up! }
